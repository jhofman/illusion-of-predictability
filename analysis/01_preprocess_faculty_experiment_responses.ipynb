Also the only thing we call the \"error\" on a set of data points is in fact the 1 sigma standard deviation.

The error bars in the plot didn\\'t even look like they were 1/2 of a standard deviation per point.  Thus if I were reviewing this paper for real I would have rejected it b/c the conclusion is very wrong (both points of 6.something were within 1 standard deviation of each other - there was no strong indication video games changed behavior) and the plot being incorrectly presented.  I don\\'t use p scores and actually don\\'t know what they mean.  We never use those in my field.  I thought they were only used in the medical field.

The \"P\" values are for the probability of a type I error for the null hypothesis of no difference between the two groups. To get the probabilities that you were asking us to guess depended on the overlap of the standard errors for different probability curves (e.g., 1.96 s.e. = two tailed 95% probability range for each group and then try to guess on the visual overlaps of the two groups at that number of s.e.! I always tried to get students to do visual estimates of various aspects during data analyses so they could have a sense of their analyses outcomes were in the right ball park. But this test was a bit more sophisticated than usual for visual estimation. I\\'m not particularly confident in my guesses, i.e., I suspect that the guesses themselves would have very wide confidence intervals even for respondents who know what they\\'re doing! (Although note: Depending partly on the sample size of respondents that you end up with (I\\'m guessing a large number*), because of the Central Limit Theorem, I would expect the estimated means of the guesses to be fairly accurate.) \\n____________\\n* Also note: The number of respondents might be a crap shoot, as \"smart\" internet users these days are not likely to respond to unsolicited emails due to the risk of malware. I was myself was very leery of responding and gave it careful and long consideration to do so. I only responded because of the @microsoft.com domain and what appeared to be too straight forward and yet sophisticated of a study to be worth a hacker\\'s time to develop and send out. But, ... I\\'m becoming leerier and leerier every day as hackers get more and more sophisticated themselves and go after specialized groups, including researchers with advanced degrees.
