I presume that's what at issue here. Just for interpretation, the likelihood ratio of a treatment versus control individual is more intuitive than guessing probability in your examples. The likelihoods tended to be small (just above 1); my intuition in how those translate into probabilities is not obvious;  say 50% probability is roughly a likelihood ration of 1:1.

The boxplot lines should have overlapped (mean of 6.8 + s.d. of 0.5 should have spanned 7.3 to 6.3 which included the mean of the other group). Though I'm not sure we were given enough information to actually answer the question. The t-test and p-values measure the likelihood the two are different. But maybe I'm just rusty on my statistics. I'd appreciate a little primer afterwards so I could learn!

(e.g. to go from descriptive statistics to probability I believe you need to compute a z-score, and use a table, or statistical calculator.)   I did not take the time to do this.  I wasn't really up for a math exam.

1. They measure the average of the log of the duration. But is it close to normal? It is not shown. SD 0.51 suggests a typical variation of sound duration of around ~500 msec. There might be a problem with outliers there.

2. The violence link is not proven. We (provided the stats is right) see that one game probably causes longer blasts than the other, but is that the violence in that game, or maybe something unrelated like screen brightness or in-game sounds volume?"

Actually there is no way answering these questions based on the observed data alone without using any priors on the distribution parameters.

Not sure how you'd phrase it, but I'd be interested to see what people thought of the sampling method. Whether or not the sample size is sufficient is partly a function of the population it was sampled from. ""Is 800 an appropriate sample size for a study like this?"" might be perceived as a slightly different question than ""Is a sample of 800 undergrads who self-selected into an intro-psychology course an appropriate sample for a study like this?"""

Reality is that i don't really believe in 'lab experiment', so I'm definitely biased. I would indeed be interested in the causal relationship between video game and violence but I'm not sure this RCT settings allows to draw conclusions outside the group of 1st year student taking an intro to psychology course. Also i would like to know more about the covariates, family history, poverty status, size of the family/siblings, mental health conditions etc.  although I understand that the RCT is supposed to make everything equal here and the point is not to understand the underlying causes.. just not the kind of study I find so useful overall
