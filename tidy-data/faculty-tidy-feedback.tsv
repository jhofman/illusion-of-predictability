What you were calling standard error, I *think* was what I know as the standard error of the mean which is roughly the sd/sqrt(N).

Also the only thing we call the ""error"" on a set of data points is in fact the 1 sigma standard deviation.

The error bars in the plot didn't even look like they were 1/2 of a standard deviation per point.  Thus if I were reviewing this paper for real I would have rejected it b/c the conclusion is very wrong (both points of 6.something were within 1 standard deviation of each other - there was no strong indication video games changed behavior) and the plot being incorrectly presented.  I don't use p scores and actually don't know what they mean.  We never use those in my field.  I thought they were only used in the medical field.

The ""P"" values are for the probability of a type I error for the null hypothesis of no difference between the two groups. To get the probabilities that you were asking us to guess depended on the overlap of the standard errors for different probability curves (e.g., 1.96 s.e. = two tailed 95% probability range for each group and then try to guess on the visual overlaps of the two groups at that number of s.e.! I always tried to get students to do visual estimates of various aspects during data analyses so they could have a sense of their analyses outcomes were in the right ball park. But this test was a bit more sophisticated than usual for visual estimation. I'm not particularly confident in my guesses, i.e., I suspect that the guesses themselves would have very wide confidence intervals even for respondents who know what they're doing!

I could have calculated the standard deviations from the standard errors and probably come up with much better estimates but instead I just looked at the distributions, the scales, and guessed.  The absence of a range on the scales made it more difficult to estimate the full distribution of scores.  Also, I've rarely been in a situation in which I've had to estimate the probability that a single score from one group would exceed the score of another group.  I'm very curious regarding what you're trying to show with this study.  By the way, the primary problem I had with your hypothetical abstract was that there were too criteria for aggressiveness but you measured only one of them, and there were alternative explanations for the finding.  The greater aggressiveness, if that's what it was, could have been a result of frustration with the game itself rather than the fact that observing violence made the respondents act more aggressively.

I then used python to figure out the mean and stddev for the rest of the questions and sampled 10000 variates from the two distributions, getting an empirical guess about the frequency of treatment being greater than control.

The researchers seems to test whether individuals can draw accurate probability estimates from graphs. The researchers give us a scenario and vary the sample size and the standard deviation and then ask us to provide a probability estimate. In my opinion, there might be serious methodological flaws in this experiment.

First, I am not sure if question that the subjects must answer is statistically correct. The questions reads something like ""what is the probability of a subject randomly chosen from one group will have a higher score than another subject randomly chosen from another group"". Hence, the question is about the distribution of individual observations.

Then there is an explanation below that says something like ""50% chance means that the two groups are not statistically significantly different from each other"". Does this refer to the distribution of individual observations or to the distribution of sample means? If


I do not think that these two statements are equivalent. One question is about two individual observations while the explanation is about parameters of two distributions. "

I worry you're about to write a paper that says people don't know how to interpret stats because their intuition about that metric was wrong, but it doesn't follow that people's judgements about the significance of results is faulty, because depending on the context, that metric might or might not be the most important factor in deciding the significance of results.  It depends why we're doing the study and what we're trying to learn.  Even an effect that is only a fraction of the overall variation might still be important.  Minor: In one of your trials, the vertical lines were not evenly spaced, specifically, the gap from 0.8 to 1.0 was not drawn to scale, and the gaps between the other vertical lines was 0.3 rather than 0.2 (I think)."

I would have much preferred to see an effect size or something like that. That said, the units they were working in were log-transformed; they probably would have been better off putting those back into ""real"" time intervals as part of their discussion and figure. In real space, the difference they were reporting was a bit more notable than it _appeared_ to be in log space; while I projected their point estimates back into real-space, I didn't do the same for their standard deviation values, and I know from experience that intervals project in complicated ways out of log space so it's possible that the error bars on their figure would have looked quite different in real space. I'm also not convinced that a t-test was the right statistical test; I imagine that the distributions of noise durations was pretty funky (with a floor and maybe also a ceiling effect) so I wonder if something non-parametric would have been a better choice. Oh, and I also would have liked to see some discussion (or at least a citation) validating their approach for measuring aggressiveness. 

As to quantitatively interpreting the simulated figures- this is something that I know I'm terrible at doing ""by sight"" so I wouldn't be surprised if my answers were wildly incorrect. As such, ""in the real world"" (i.e., when it matters), I often work out the appropriate proportions as part of making sense of a figure. Similarly, for interpreting standard error vs. standard deviation, that's something I often find myself needing to look up to make sure I'm getting correct. I didn't do that here, since I'm assuming that part of the goal is to find out how many of us actually _know_ this stuff properly! 🤣"

That approach greatly reduced the probability of differences for randomly chosen singe examples. I made no attempt to calculate the probabilities accurately but simply used my rough knowledge of Gaussian statistics.

Would have liked a reminder on the difference between standard deviation (reported in the abstract) and standard error (reported on the plot). When you say ""guess"" and ""estimate"" it also wasn't clear if you wanted us to compute anything or not (which goes back to the plot question...); it's an easy question to answer if I were going to compute, but I'm not fluent with the associated probability tables so in various places I did estimate. Also, before I saw the 'guess/estimate' part, for the first probability, I did run the numbers via a quick simulation as that's much faster than the algebra. "

I am unclear about diff betw standard deviation and standard error (if any).  Questions about probability seemed difficult to work out technically.  I used rule of thumb that pr of being 1 sd from mean is about 2/3, 2 sd about 9/10, 3 sd about 99/100 -- or maybe should have been 97/100.  I have no intuition about sample size n = 60 versus n =400."

Such summaries are very important in some branches of science — and not at all important in others.   So I was surprised to see that you did not ask any background questions about field of expertise.

I was mentally trying to double the interval but not always very well, and I know I tended initially to dismiss all the results that didn't meet my best guess of being statistically significant at .05 level. But I wasn't willing to do the mental arithmetic for calculating the actual odds for a stupid test like this.
