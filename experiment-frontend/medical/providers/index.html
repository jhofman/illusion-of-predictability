				<p>This survey is completely anonymous and should take less than 10 minutes to complete.</p>

					Your voluntary participation will contribute to our scientific understanding of how clinicians think about evidence

						patients,
						and
						that it has been tested in a double-blind, randomized controlled trial restricted to patients
						with
						high systolic blood pressure.
					</p>
					<p>
						Each patient's systolic blood pressure was measured by a physician in a pre-treatment
						examination,
						and if patients qualified for the trial they were randomly assigned to either a control or
						treatment
						group. <b>In the pre-treatment phase, participants in both groups had an average systolic blood
							pressure of 130mm Hg. There were 150 patients in each of the treatment and control
							groups.</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						The control group received a placebo and the treatment group received the new medication.
						Several
						months later, each patient's systolic blood pressure was again measured by a physician in a
						post-treatment examination.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Here is a summary of the results of the trial, which are depicted in the figure to the
							right:</b>

						In the trial, patients admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 were randomly assigned to either a
